### 5. Conclusion

I hope this note may have helped you to get started to develop your own plugin. I will describe more extension points as soon as I go into them in depth.

The main thing I hope this note has highlighted is that writing a Jenkins plugin is quite simple. The [documentation](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins) is really helpful, and the huge amount of [available open source plugins](https://github.com/jenkinsci) will enable you to learn by the exemple.
