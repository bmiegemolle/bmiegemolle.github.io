Layout structure highlights
---------------------------

### The root folder

It contains (among other things) all standard pages in English version, such as:

* `index.html`
* `phd.html`
* `blog.html`
* ...

### The `fr` folder

It contains all standard pages (the same as the ones in the root folder), translated in French.

### The `_layouts` folder

This folder contains all layout files, i.e:

* `default.html`: the layout for standard pages in English version (with menus and right frames in English)
* `default_fr.html`: the layout for standard pages in French version (with menus and right frames in French)
* `post.html`: the layout for blog posts (only available in English version)

### The `_posts` folder

All blog posts go in this folder.

### The `tech` folder

This folder contains all multipage technical notes. A folder is created for each note that will include a page per note.

```

### The `_includes` folder

It contains all HTML files to be included in other files, in particular:
