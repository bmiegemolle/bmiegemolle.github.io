		I currently work for <strong>Sierra Wireless</strong>, global leader
		in machine-to-machine (M2M). We implement a cloud service platform
		that enables to remotely manage connected devices. I have two main

		</ul>
		<hr />
		I also occasionally work for the <strong>INSA of Toulouse</strong>, a
		French engineering college. I'm part of <strong>VAE jurys</strong>, a
		procedure that enables people to obtain an engineer's degree based on
		their working experience (VAE stands for "Validation des Acquis de
		l'Exp√©rience", which could be roughly translated into "Validation of
		Experience Knowledge").

		Even if my little family takes me a lot of my free time, I have some
		activities on my spare time. Here are some examples:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Android development:</strong> after a hard working
				day, what's better than coding Android? :-)</li>
			<li><strong>Music :</strong> I mainly play electric guitar, but
				I also play bass, piano and drums.</li>
			<li><strong>Board games :</strong> with my family, colleagues or
				friends, it's always fun!</li>
			<li><strong>Sport :</strong> Roller skating, squash, ski, when I
				have some free time...</li>
